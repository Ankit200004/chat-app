# ðŸ“± Real-Time Chat App

This project is a **real-time 1:1 chat application** built using **React Native (frontend)** and **Node.js + Socket.IO (backend)**. It allows users to register, log in, view a list of other users, and start real-time conversations. The app is designed with a modern UI using **React Native Paper** with a customized theme.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Authentication**
  - Secure registration and login using JWT-based authentication.
  - Persistent user sessions with context-based state management.

- **User List**
  - Displays all registered users in the system.
  - Each user item is interactive, allowing you to start a conversation.

- **Real-Time Chat**
  - One-to-one messaging powered by **Socket.IO**.
  - Messages are instantly sent and received without refreshing.
  - Chat history is stored in the backend database for persistence.

- **Error Handling**
  - Alerts for network issues, invalid credentials, and unauthorized access.
  - Automatic logout if the session expires (401 handling).

- **UI/UX**
  - Built with **React Native Paper** and a custom theme:
    - `primary` â†’ Green (#4CAF50)
    - `secondary` â†’ Amber (#FFC107)
    - Clean typography and modern design.
  - Loading indicators and user-friendly messages for smooth navigation.

## ðŸš€ How It Works

1. A new user **registers** or logs in.
2. After login, they are redirected to the **Home screen**, where all users are listed.
3. Tapping a user opens the **Chat screen**, where messages are exchanged in real time.
4. Messages are persisted in the database, so they remain available even after app restarts.
5. The **theme system** ensures consistent design across all screens.

The goal of this project is to provide a **foundation for a production-ready chat application** that is:
- **Scalable**
- **User-friendly**
- **Secure**
- **Easily customizable** (thanks to modularized components and theming)
